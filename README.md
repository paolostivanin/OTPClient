Highly secure and easy to use GTK+ software for two-factor authentication that supports both Time-based One-time Passwords (TOTP) and HMAC-Based One-Time Passwords (HOTP).

## Requirements
|Name| Min Version |
|----|-------------|
|GTK+| 3.20        |
|Glib| 2.48.0      |
|jansson| 2.6.0       |
|libgcrypt| 1.6.0       |
|libzip| 1.0.0       |
|libpng| 1.2.0       |
|[libcotp](https://github.com/paolostivanin/libcotp)| 1.2.1       |-|
|zbar| 0.20        |

## Features
- support both TOTP and HOTP
- support setting custom digits (between 4 and 10 inclusive)
- support setting a custom period (between 10 and 120 seconds inclusive)
- support SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 algorithms
- support for Steam codes (please read [THIS PAGE](https://github.com/paolostivanin/OTPClient/wiki/Steam-Support))
- import encrypted [Authenticator Plus](https://www.authenticatorplus.com/) backup
- import and export encrypted and/or plain [andOTP](https://github.com/flocke/andOTP) backup
- import and export plain [FreeOTPPlus](https://github.com/helloworld1/FreeOTPPlus) backup (key URI format only)
- import and export plain [Aegis](https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis) backup (plain json only)
- local database is encrypted using AES256-GCM
  - key is derived using PBKDF2 with SHA512 and 100k iterations
  - decrypted file is never saved (and hopefully never swapped) to disk. While the app is running, the decrypted content resides in a "secure memory" buffer allocated by Gcrypt

## Testing
* Before each release, I run PVS Studio in order to catch even more errors and/or corner cases
* With every commit to master, OTPClient is compiled in CircleCI against different distros

## Wiki

## Manual installation
