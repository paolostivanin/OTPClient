Highly secure and easy to use GTK+ software for two-factor authentication that supports both Time-based One-time Passwords (TOTP) and HMAC-Based One-Time Passwords (HOTP).

## Requirements
|Name|Min Version|Suggested Version|Notes|
|----|-----------|-----------------|-----|
|GTK+|3.18|-|-|
|Glib|2.48.0|-|-|
|jansson|2.8.0|-|-|
|libgcrypt|1.6.0|-|-|
|libzip|1.0.0|-|-|
|libpng|1.2.0|-|-|
|[libcotp](https://github.com/paolostivanin/libcotp)|1.1.0|-|
|zbar|0.10|0.20 ([linuxtv](https://linuxtv.org/downloads/zbar/))|-|

## Features
- support both TOTP and HOTP
- support 6 and 8 digits
- support SHA1, SHA256 and SHA2512 algorithms
- import encrypted [Authenticator Plus](https://www.authenticatorplus.com/) backup
- import encrypted [andOTP](https://github.com/flocke/andOTP) backup
- encrypt local file using AES256-GCM
  - key is derived using PBKDF2 with SHA512 and 100k iterations
  - decrypted file is never saved (and hopefully never swapped) to disk. While the app is running, the decrypted content resides in a "secure memory" buffer allocated by Gcrypt 
- auto-refresh TOTP every 30 seconds
- when a row is **ticked**, the otp is automatically copied to the clipboard (which is erased before terminating the program)
  - another otp value can still be copied by double clicking it when the **row is ticked**
